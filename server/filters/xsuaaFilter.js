/**
 * xsuaaFilter.js returns a new instance of "passport", including an XSUAA related JWTStrategy 
 *  
 * The Bearer strategy ensures, that only requests which can be authenticated by the XSUAA binding
 * are processed by the backend. This is required to protect the notification endpoint of the 
 * extension application. SAP Cloud Integration which is sending requests to this endpoint, has 
 * the Client Credentials of this XSUAA instance configured so only these calls are processed. Other
 * calls from the public internet will not be granted access by this JWTStrategy.
