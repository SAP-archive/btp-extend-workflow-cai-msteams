# Extend your business workflow with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook

## Description
Extend SAP productivity by leveraging Microsoft Teams and Outlook as engagement channels for workflows. This scenario demonstrates how the Leave Request process of SAP SuccessFactors can be seamlessly integrated with business functions such as chat, email, and calendar, all relying on the SAP BTP integration capabilites. By bringing contextually relevant information to users, you enable them to focus on priority tasks with an improved business process experience. This use case illustrates numerous integration points for increased productivity with Microsoft applications, such as SAP Conversational AI, SAP Workflow Management, and SAP Integration Suite. It showcases the intelligent enterprise by leveraging BTP kernel services for a frictionless and secure end to end experience.

## Scopes

This mission consists of three different evolution steps, which get more and more comprehensive from a Basic, an Advanced up to a Full implementation scope. By following the Basic scope, you will learn how to use SAP Workflow Management, a CAP application and SAP Conversational AI to integrate with Micrsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams. 

In the Advanced scope you will see how to fit an SAP SuccessFactors instance into the architecture, using SAP Integration Suite and your existing SAP Conversational AI implementation. This will allow you to interact with a real business workflow in the SAP SuccessFactors application environment. 

The Full scope architecture will cover the implementation of a native Micrsoft Teams app and will make your scenario enterprise ready, by using end-to-end Principal Propagation from Microsoft Teams to SAP SuccessFactors. Furthermore the Advanced and Full scopes will include an SAP Task Center instance integration, which is one of the latest SAP Business Technology Platform services, planned to be released in Q4/2021.
